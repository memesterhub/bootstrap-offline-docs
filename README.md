# bootstrap-offline-docs

## This is the latest bootstrap documentation if there are any issues u can submit it to issues or if you know how to fix it submit a pull request and thank you :)
## ill try updating this repo on every version of bootstrap this is the latest version bootstrap5
## NOTE: the documentation will be defaulted to the latest release but u can access old releases at anytime because they will be as a zip file and it will be in a single release but sadly i started this when it was version bootstrap4.5.x wich means the >3.x releases are not supported but bootstrap4.5.x< are supported happily
